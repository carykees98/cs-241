# Homework 2 - Instructions

Write a function rightrot(x, n) that returns the value of the integer x rotated to the right by n bit positions.

You can assume an int has 32 bits

“Rotation” means that bits that shift off the right side get put back onto the left side – but that doesn’t mean you have to implement this bit by bit

In order to show that your program actually works, you'll need to figure out how to print out the data before and after rotation - either in binary or in hex.
