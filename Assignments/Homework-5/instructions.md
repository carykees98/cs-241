# Homework 5 - Instructions

Write a version of strlen that uses pointers

A small driver is:
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main ()
{
char a[] = “Count the length of this string”;

printf (“%d characters in %s\n”, my_strlen(a), a);

}
```

Hint: inside the function, the parameter a is a pointer to a char.

Put your driver and the function into a c file called strlen.c
